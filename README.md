To accomplish this project, I wrote an SQL query to retrieve General Ledger Data from a database that I accessed via Azure Data Studio. Then I created a SQL view in order to use it later on for building a data model in Power BI. I applied several techniques to build these financial statements such as the creation of headers table and DAX measures that helped me with the layout of the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.
